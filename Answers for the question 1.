 2.12 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the same system call interface for manipulating both files and devices?

Answer:
In UNIX, the same system call interface is used for both files and devices.

Advantages:
1)It gives uniformity, since the same calls like open(), read(), write() can work for files as well as devices.
2)Makes programming easier and also supports I/O redirection (like output can go to file, screen, or printer without changing code).
3)Improves portability, as the same code works across systems.

Disadvantages:
1)Not all devices behave like files, some need special functions (like ejecting a CD).
2)So extra system calls like ioctl() are required.
3)Sometimes it adds overhead and may reduce efficiency for devices.

Example: A file "/home/file.txt" and a device </dev/tty> can both be read using read(). But for special device operations, normal file calls are not enough.

So overall, it makes the system simple and consistent, but device-specific needs still need extra handling.
