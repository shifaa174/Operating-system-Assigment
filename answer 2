 2.13 Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system-call interface provided by the operating system?

  Yes, a user can develop a new command interpreter using the system-call interface. A command interpreter (shell) is just a program that takes user commands 
  and uses system calls like fork() to create a new process, exec() to run the program, and exit() to end it. For example, when we type a command, the shell 
  simply asks the operating system through these system calls to run it. This means anyone can write their own shell program, because the OS already provides 
  the necessary system calls. That is why UNIX has many shells like bash and zsh, all built in the same way.
