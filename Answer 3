2.14: Describe why Android uses ahead-of-time(AOT) rather than just-in-time (JIT) compilation?

Answer:
JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation compiles code at runtime (while the app is running). 
AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation compiles code into machine code before the app opens.

Android may prefer AOT compilation for many reasons like: 
1. Performance Improvement: AOT compiles apps to native machine code once (at install/first launch). This reduces runtime overhead since the app doesn’t need to compile code repeatedly.
2. Battery Efficiency: JIT consumes CPU cycles for compiling during runtime which wastes battery. AOT avoids repeated compilation that leads to lower energy usage.
3. Consistent Performance: With AOT, the app runs predictably since it’s already compiled.
4. Reduced Memory Usage: Unlike AOT, JIT needs extra memory for storing compiled code during each execution.
